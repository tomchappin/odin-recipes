The Odin Project - HTML Assignment

-- Pre-Assignment Comment --

This is the first assignment of The Odin Project foundations course. I'm tasked with creating an HTML site, presumably displaying recipes (not sure yet), which will be styled with CSS later in the course. 

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time I'm finished with it (no CSS) but it's an important practice exercise to apply the HTML knowledge I've learnt so far. 

Feeling pretty confident, but let's see what I produce...
