        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Oxtail Rendang curry will set your tastebuds alight. A slightly more indulgent version of the classic Malaysian dish, beef rendang. The fatty oxtail adds a depth of flavour that simply can't be matched!</p>

        </ul>
        <h5>Curry</h5>

            <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Korean red chili flakes, or other hot chili flakes</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground cardomom</li>
            <li>1 stalk lemongrass, bruised and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tamarind paste</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 cup water,  or as needed</li>
            <li>chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>fresh lime wedges</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees F). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Place oxtails on the pan and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil; toss to coat and space out evenly.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. </li>
            <li>For curry base, add shallots, garlic, ginger, galangal, jalapenos, and Fresno chilies to a food processor and process until a fine paste forms.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add curry base, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture dries out and begins to toast onto the bottom of the pan, 4 to 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Season with salt, coriander, turmeric, chili flakes, nutmeg, and cardamom and cook, stirring, for 1 minute more. Add coconut milk, tamarind paste, brown sugar, and lemongrass. Stir, scraping the bottom of the pan to deglaze, then pour in beef broth to deglaze. </li>
            <li>Add oxtails and enough water to just cover the meat. Increase heat to high until sauce just starts to boil, then reduce to low. Cover and simmer until meat can be easily pulled off the bone, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Set the oven to 150 degrees F (66 degrees C). Transfer oxtails to an ovenproof pan, and place in the oven to keep warm. </li>
            <li>Boil sauce over high heat to reduce until it is as thick as you like, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Spoon sauce over oxtails and garnish with cilantro and lime wedges. Serve on rice if desired.</li>
        </ol>
