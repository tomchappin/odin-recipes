            <li>Salt and round black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>96 Wonton wrappers</li>
            <li>
                Cheese:
                <ul>
                    <li>7 cups of grated parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>7 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                    <li>3 cups ricotta cheese </li>
                </ul>

            <li>4 cups pasta sauce (such as Dolmio)</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped fresh basil, or to taste (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Drain and discard grease from beef.</li>
            <li>Cut wonton wrappers into 2 1/4-inch circles with a biscuit cutter. Press one wonton into the bottom of each muffin cup. Sprinkle even amounts of Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and ricotta cheese into each muffin cup; top each portion with even amounts of ground beef and pasta sauce.</li>
            <li>Divide 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the ground beef mixture, and 1/2 cup pasta sauce, between the muffin cups and layer, respectively, atop wonton wrapper; repeat layering with remaining wonton wrappers, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, remaining ricotta cheese, remaining ground beef, and remaining pasta sauce. Top "cupcakes" with remaining Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until edges of "cupcakes" are browned, 18 to 20 minutes; let rest in tins for 5 minutes before running a knife around the edges to loosen and remove. Garnish with fresh basil to serve.</li>
        </ol>
